    "text": "Over 150 attendees at the PSI conference player the Exploristics Higher or Lower web app - and didn’t they all do well!? I was delighted to see the game generated so much interest, many people expressed an interest in the how we deployed the app on the cloud and that’s the motivation for this blog. This app is a microcosm of developing and deploying a Statistical Shiny app on the cloud. This blog is aimed at people who are experienced in developing desktop R scripts and have a desire to take the next step to create a Shiny app and deploy on the cloud.\nThe premise of our app was simply to act as a hook to encourage attendees to visit the Exploristics stand and learn more about the products and services we offer. The challenge was to gather requirements, design, develop, implement, test and deploy an application that was a simple game in only a few days!\nThe Higher of Lower game is based on the classic card game: an initial card is drawn from a standard deck of cards. Another card is then drawn from the deck and the player must guess if this drawn card will be of higher or lower value than the initial card. From a statistical perspective this is quite a simple process – random sampling without replacement of the deck and a logic-based approach of the guess. Although the statistical method and issues faced may seem trivial, they provide tangible examples of many of common issues faced and I attempt to generalize the solutions. When you attempt to deploy more complex statistical models it’ll be easier to identify the issues you’re facing, how to debug your code and solver your problems.\nAt Exploristics we use Shiny apps to provide dynamic and interactive visualization tools to enable clients to interpret the complex multi-dimensional data or models generated by KerusCloud. At the Jumping Rivers Shiny in Production conference, I spoke about the experiences and technology to create robust enterprise grade Shiny applications. However, the remit for the Higher or Lower application was very different from how we usually develop software – this was to be a one-off application to be used at the PSI conference and we only had a couple of days for development. This mean that many of our usual processes needed to be accelerated and we had to accept some trade-offs.\nAlthough we have experience in developing Shiny apps using a new technology such as Shinyapps.io usually leads to unexpected changes that take time to resolve. The time frame was extremely short to deal with any technology issues and  address any feedback from stakeholders. However, as our preliminary research into Shinyapps.io looked promising we decided to have a go!.\n“If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.”\nIsaac Newton\nR and Shiny are open source and supported by a vibrant and passionate community of individuals. Without the years of effort and innovation from these individuals I would not have been able to deliver the app within our timescales. Any difficulty I faced on my part is not a criticism of these individuals but rather my experience under extremely tight time constraints that resulted in a limited amount of time to research appropriate solutions."

Senior staff didn’t get to their technical ability without many frustrations and these are ok!\nI’ve found software development is a very risk averse industry. Requirements are gathered up front and making a seemingly simple change can have cascading effects on the software which leads to individuals wanting to work within very defined boundaries. Having two children of my own I’ve learnt that the only way to learn is to make mistakes! If you only did what you know you could do, you’d never learn to crawl, walk or talk. Children will happily fall over a dozen times in a row but eventually they’ll be walking.\nI’ve done a lot of in-house lunchtime knowledge transfer sessions, these were generally aimed at novice R users wanting to improve their analysis scripts through writing functions or packages. Bringing these together online will hopefully be of use to novice users. They’re not aimed at being a definitive resource but an alternative explanation to technical documentation, providing the minimal steps people require to get a functional benefit."
